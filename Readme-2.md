# Initiating the NEST-JS Project for backend

    NestJS is a Node.js framework that is opinionated and strongly built with TypeScript, which makes it highly maintainable, scalable, and robust

# Folder Structure for the NEST-JS

    main.ts – Considered the heart of NestJS, this file initializes the backend and boots up the entire application.

    app.module.ts – The root module of the application. It unites all controllers, providers, and modules used in the app.

    common/ – This folder is used for reusable pieces of code like pipes, guards, decorators, and filters. Write once, use anywhere.

    utils/ – Contains utility functions that perform common computations or helper tasks.

    .env – Stores environment variables. NestJS uses @nestjs/config package to easily manage environment-specific settings.
